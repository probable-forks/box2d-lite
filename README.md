A fork of [Box2d-Lite](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d-lite) used for a demo at ACCU 2021 and [CppCon2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYCin0B037Y). 

# Box2D-Lite
Box2D-Lite is a small 2D physics engine. It was developed for the [2006 GDC Physics Tutorial](docs/GDC2006_Catto_Erin_PhysicsTutorial.pdf). This is the original version of the larger [Box2D](https://box2d.org) library. The Lite version is more suitable for learning about game physics.
